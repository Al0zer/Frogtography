## THE STORY
Deep within the forest lies the small and quaint town of Salientia, populated by an
abundance of cute frogs and townsfolk who just so happen to be talking animals. The town
is closed off from the rest of the world and no human has ever stepped foot into it... Until
one day, you arrive at its doorstep.

Youâ€™re an aspiring photographer and frog enthusiast who has found their way into this
whimsical town, and you decide to make your mark as a photographer by taking pictures of
their frogs. You might even befriend them!

## HOW TO PLAY
**Run the .exe file under the Builds folder to start playing!**

In each level, you must try to reach the minimum score to win. Earn points by taking pictures of frogs (and only frogs). You also have a limited number of film for each level. The level will end once you run out of film. As the levels progress, the minimum score and number of film will increase, and you'll notice the frogs will start to speed up! Furthermore, you might start to run into some enemies. If you take a picture of them, you'll lose points, so be careful! 

Move your camera around the screen using the **WASD** keys. To focus your camera, hold down on **LEFT SHIFT**. While focused, you can snap a shot by pressing **SPACE**! 

While focused, you'll notice a cross-hair in the center of the frame. This is important! The closer the frog is to the center of the frame, the more points you'll earn. A *PERFECT* shot will get you 160 points. *GOOD* shots get you 120 points. And *OK* shots get you 100 points. If there is no frog in the frame, you'll get 0 points. 

## EXTRA INFO
Made in Unity. All sprites, backgrounds, UI elements and additional 2D assets were hand drawn by me. I do not own any of the music used in this game.
